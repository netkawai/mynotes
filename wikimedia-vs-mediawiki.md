When I checked Listing list API on Wikipedia, I little bit am confused below page for Web APIs.

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API#API_comparison

There are two distinguished words  Wikimedia vs Mediawiki.
I note down here what they are in a programmer perspective.

Wikimedia is a project/organization name to host Wikipedia/Wikitionary etc and provide free online encyclopedia/dictionary etc funded from charity/donations ... There is NO wikimedia software, it will be a similar to a company name.

Mediawiki is a wiki engine developed by Wikimeida as open/free source. However some of source codes. e.g. Wikimeida REST API is NOT open-source code used in e.g. Wikipedia/Wikitionary. Mediawiki is a core wiki engine, Mediawiki adds some proprietary codes (mostly privacy concerns, security and tuning part to Wikimedia's real infrastructure) and deploy their proprietary software to their infra.

Literally, Cloud/Online software had killed Richard Stallman's dream already. There is no pure open source online service in the real world.
