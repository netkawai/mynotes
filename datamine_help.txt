The Datamine file (.dm) needs to have the following columns or else it will be rejected from the
import process:
•XP - x coordinate of the point of a hole - meters or feet
•YP - y coordinate of the point of a hole - meters or feet
•ZP - z coordinate of the point of a hole - meters or feet
•PTN - the coordinate index i.e. how the points are ordered from start to finish. This
number would describe the collar coordinate as the first point and the toe coordinate as the last
point. It is possible to have more than two points in this list
•PVALUE - this value groups together coordinates into lines. Coordinates with the same
pvalue belong to the same line
•RING - The ring number that the hole belongs to.
•HOLE - The hole number
•AZIMUTH - The azimuth of the ring line - measured from true north it is not the look
direction but rather the angle of the ring relative to true north. Basically the angle of the plane
normal is (AZIMUTH + 90 degrees) mod 360
•DIP - The dip of the ring as measured from the horizontal where 90 indicates a perfectly
vertical ring
•XPIVOT - x coordinate of the hole pivot point
•YPIVOT - y coordinate of the hole pivot point
•ZPIVOT - z coordinate of the hole pivot point
•XORIG - x coordinate of the ring plane origin which is some point on the ring. The point
where the reference line and the ring itself intersect - meters or feet
•YORIG - y coordinate of the ring plane origin. The point where the reference line and the
ring itself intersect - meters or feet

•ZORIG - z coordinate of the ring plane origin. The point where the reference line and the
ring itself intersect - meters or feet
NOTE: XORIG, YORIG & ZORIG will be used to construct a reference line for the stope when it is
imported.
