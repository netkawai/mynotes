Nowadays, instead of using backend, just import json file when build! frontend and generate static resource
In this way, you don't need anything backend process.

One example is this one. so just data.js (not technically conformant to JSON but json) and import in index.vue
To processing frontend, everyone assumes that nodejs exits, so technically, if we have a sqlite3 file, just can generate js file
and import in the same process, then upload, and combined with Sphinx, you can host in static pages with code generations.

There is a person already created in github template

I can use this template simply and re-organize so that, I can see more easily by myself for this notes
