80386 was introudced orthogonal, register beame as more general register not a paticular for instruction
Add FS,GS as segment register
IBM PC 1981 hit in small business
Cheap $2000 keyboard was realiable
The first generation of IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT was sold,
They did not have inter-compatiblity of hardware which includes DISK controller. If programers did not use system call(software interrupt) provided by
BIOS/DOS, user should select the correct hardware driver version and component.
IBM introuced the second generation PS/2, shift licensed non-open Platform.
However, PC market required the compablity with PC/AT, as standard platform PC which was established as Industrial Standard.
PC/AT compatible platform intorduced prephieral of 3.5inch FDD(720KB), PS/2 AUX(Mouse), VGA] for increametal
Functionalities. CPU becamse from 80286 to 80386SX, non-IBM braned IBM PC compatible PC became the
Standard PC includes Qemu/VirtualBox
The memory map of Intel CPU(x86,64)
Logical address -->(segement)-->Linear address--(page transition)-->physical address
The CPU has two Segment types (Data or Code etc) Descriptor in
Global Descriptor Table(GDT) and Local Descriptor Table(LDT)
The structure of segment Selector(CS/DS/SS/ES/FS/GS) is
13bit            1bit 2bit
(Selector)(T1) (privilege level)
And T1=0 is GDT, T1=1 is LDT to indicate each descriptor table
16bit Protect Mode in 80286 has logically the address of13bit + 16bit = 29bit/512MB
If Both of GDT and LDT are considered separate address space, the CPU of logical
Address space is 1G,
GDT(Global Description Table) register should be set to address(16bit or 32bit)  which has the base address and length of array for GDT memory area, the register has called shadow register for storing the base address and length of GDT. That is why, GDTR is 16bit 4KB boundary.
Descriptor Entry structure
20bit(limit) + 32bit(base linear address)+12bit(Descirptor information)    = 1entry(8byte) .
1entry is 8byte, GDT has 13bit => the maximu size of table is 8191 (8*8191 = 63KB)
The protect mode in 80286 compatible mode cae use base linear whtin 20bit, limit is within 16bit
This is controlled by  G bit in descriptor. This mode has compatibility with 80286
The other register apart from 6 general registers are  IP,SP,BP, which become 16bit(Win16).
The bit width of general registers are indicated by prefix, which was concept to add FPS instructions and
extended instruction architecture.
User can define LDT descript in the 8191 GDTs used by LDTR
(Is this option? Not mondatory)
LDT Descriptor
20bit(limit) + 32bit(base linear address)+type(8bit)+ 0 (4bit)
The entry sturecutre is the same, LDTR hold selector value which indicate
which GDT has the segment for LDT.
(least 3 bit is ignored in 16bit)
Indeed, GDT can hld multiple LDT Descriptors. System software can change LDTR
Even though CS, DS, ES has the same selector value, software can access the different physical memory address
I still do not investigate that Windows 3.0/3.1 used this mechanism for local heap??
IDT register is set to indicate the head of arrary of Interrupt descriptor tables
IDT(Interrupt Description Table) register
IDT table entry structure
32bit(offset addr) , selector(16bit), (4bit)copy count, type(8bit), 0(4bit) = 1entry(8byte)
INT instruction use 8it, IDT tables defined upto 256 (256*8 = 2KB)
System register is the  only one set, even though dual/quard CPU(SMP)
If system will load the selector into segment register, CPU has hidden registers to load
Offset address as well as full descriptor information.
Type of Global Descriptor/Interrupt Descriptor
1  Active 16bit TSS
2  LDT
3  Busy 16bit TSS
4  16bit call gate
5  task gate
6  16bit interrupt gate
7  16bit trap gate
8  reserve
9  Active 32bit TSS
10 reserve
11 busy 32bit TSS
12 32bit call gate
13 reserve
14 32bit interrupt gate
15 32bit trap gate
In x86, system can use Interrupt(INT) as system call which are defined in RISC for independent instuction.
System software has to set Interrupt type for interrupt
Task State Segment(TSS) was used in NTVM only to run DOS/WIN32 applications
AMD64 does not support TSS.
Linux2.0/2.2/2.4 did use TSS to implement task switch , however, Linux2.6 or the above do not use TSS.
However Linux still uses to switch STACK for interrupt(software and hardware) Linux set 1TSS for 1CPU
In dual core, linux set 2TSS. The system register set is one, however dual core can run simulaneously different interrupt task.
Olitz wrote 386BSD book(The Basic Kernel Source Code Secrets). They mentioned the issue of TSS
That is slow due to load total 104 byte memory for task context switch
Kernel(System) address space does not have the information of kernel stack and stack status.
All stack of each process should be shared within the same virtual(Linear) address.
System can not create the nested thread within multiple process
When some process will exit, system can not restore context from the process which will exit.
However, TSS only can set EFLAG to set v86 flag to enter VM86 mode.
Moreover, TSS can set CR3 to restore page directory entry to switch physical memory space
against the same linear address(0x00000 - 0x10FFFE) between multi-real mode environment(specifically DOS).
The standard mode and enchanced mode of Windows 3.0 is almost identical except memory handle and dos prompt.
The standard mode can not handle multi-dos instance, which means the support only single dos (full screen mode).
The enhacned mode support multi-dos instance with window, because os can utilize the paging feature of 386.
And In my guessing, OS use 386 TSS for vm86 and 286 TSS to emulate standard mode in 386.
Microsoft might not use 286 TSS in the standard mode for task switching. In the case, most probably,
OS can not do preemptive switch between win16.
There would be one 286 TSS for win16 apps, multiple 386 for dos instances
The linear address of win16 apps were shared, no segregation.
If OS specify all port map, the size of a TSS for v86 is about 4byte*64 + 256bit(8byte)+1byte=113byte
Page Table Entry
System should set the top 20bit address of CR3 to indiecate Page Entry Directory
The MSB of 10bit in logical address(Linear address) +Page Entry Directory + the address of Page Entry
The linear  of 10bit from Page Entry can indicate a page to decide an address.
10bit + 10bit + 12bit
For v86 mode, page directory is not required. OS can assume 0 in the directory.
10bit~1024->1KB memory require for page management.+TSS ~ 2KB
64KB(GDT+LDT)+IDT(64KB)+64KB(V86+PAGE+TSS)
In Windows, however, Microsoft did not use 286TSS for task switching and memory separation.
In my guessing, one is performance and another is compatibility.
They  implemented Windows 1.0 in real mode. In real mode,
CPU does not have any facility to separate memory space.
In Windows 2.0, they started to support 286 protect mode to break the barrier of 640KB.
However, they had already implemented DLL(shared object library) on assuming that
all application can share memory space.
Unlike paging, segment based memory swap such as LDT was too complicated
to co-existent the separate and sharing areas in memory
Microsoft simply gave up to separate application memory space in 80286(16bit protected mode).
This decision make them keep easy to share the same code base between 286(Standard) and 386(Enchanced)
except handle of DOS instances.
Moreover, TSS for 286 was too heavy to utilize task switching at the time.
Microsoft simply introduced cooperative multi-task.
All win16 apps had to share  memory space and cooperative multi-task on task switching in GetMessage/PeekMessage/WaitEvent
to kick reschedule task
In DOS instances in enhanced mode, they only used native 386TSS and paging for lower-memory(1MB)
Real Mode(8086 mode)
If the mask of A20M# enables, the above 1MB was masked (8086)
However,  the standard of APCI require to disable A20M#
Intel CPU has three types of instructions
Memory Space
I/O Space
MSR Space
APIC requires hareware register in physical address of 0x000FEE00-0x000FFFFF
This range of address in IBM PC/XT(8086) was the reset vector.
80286 or the above CPU does not use this range. The above 03386 reset into  0xFFFFFFF0 in IP register.
The CS selector register has hidden register to keep the address offset for code segment(0xFFFF).
The reset value of EIP register offset has 0x0000FFF0 and CS + EIP is 0xFFFFFFF0
Till system load cs selector value into the register, system execute far jump or far call,
The segement of address range of 0xFFFF0000-0xFFFFFFFF(64KB) was shared among code and data
Intel softare maual has a piece of code to switch real mode to protect mode.
BIOS can access whole physical address after swithced Protect Mode, do check memory and
Initialize chipset, register ACPI service as PC/AT, initialize VGA(Graphic)
In my guessing, BIOS execute and issue the reuqest of initialization of PCI Bus Device.
If BIOS has found VGA PCI Card, BIOS expect this PCI Card required VGA compatilibity with IO and memory space
System BIOS initalize TEXT MODE(80x25)
In legacy algorithm, BIOS search VIDEO BIOS in the address of 0xC0000.
After initalize, system keep Boot Block, switch into Real Mode, far jump to Boot Block
After switched Real Mode, APCI require  legacy compability with PC/AT BIOS service.

Maximun RAM memory in 80286(PCAT) is the same16MB(24bit)
The below address of 1MB Address are similar to IBM PC for 640KB for user rAM
PC/XT has MDA/CGA  BIOS. EGA/VGA card had their own BIOS in the card placed in
0xC0000-0xCFFFF
Linus bought PC which of spec was 386-compatible PC CPU 80386SX 4MB:RAM 120MB:HDD in 1991
In MS-DOS, Microsfot introduced HIMEM.SYS/EMM386.EXE on Windows 3.0.
They can use high memory, however, still in real mode, they can not use 32bit mode.
Some program use  D0000-EFFFF to switch page to allocate data into 1MB.
INT10h MODE 02h,03h
TEXT MODE:80x25 FONT SIZE:9x14 -> 720x400dot 16 color within 16bit color
(MDA/EGA has the same number of displaying character)
INT 10h MODE 12h
GRAPHIC MODE: 640x480dot 16 color within 16bit color (High resoution mode in VGA)
INT 10h MODE 13h/X-Mode
GRAPHIC MODE: 320x200/320x240 256 with 16bit color (256 color mode in VGA)
Independent VIDEO Chip Vendor started to sell Highend video card with compabile register of onriginal
VGA Card.
IBM PS/2 supported the resolutions of 800x600,1024x768. These vendors also supported the resolutions 
with their own way(VideoCard : IBM 8514/ET3000/ET400/Tur64 S3/GD5430 etc)
DOS can not support all these cards, applications supported them within their code.
To improve this situation, VESA was founded. Graphics extended BIOS was standardized as
VESA Extension BIOS
Windows95/NT supported this BIOS natively.
After while, to increate Windows Application, the applications do not reply on BIOS, Windows provide APIs
To access functionalities.
After introduced USB, ACPI and 32bit, BIOS marker or BIOS open source were implemented with C Language
in protect mode.However in VBE also, APIC was provided stanard access way to get adddress information and
Legacy function which does not have high compatible among vendors, were called by INT instruction which was used 
by old sofware which does not need to worry about address space.
APCI provide these mechanisms, however only OS vendors(Microsoft/Linux/BSD) should support them, application marker does not need it.
Windows PC is the standard collection of IBM PC, Intel and Microsoft
That is why, In physical real mode and virutla 8086 mode, application most only use INT insturction to call system functions.
Even though, they use DOS4G mode(32bit mode), application do not worry about which mode is used.
Application execute INT instructions, applications do not need to worry about which mode and address which were set by system library(DOS4G/NTVDM)

The key scan code of AT Keyboard were implemented in ps2.c
SVGA Mode was depend on VESA BIOS. However, Intel introduced built-in PCI VGA as 2nd defacto standard.
Til PCI/Pentium/Windows95, many PC had ISA bus(16bit)
However, before PCI, some PCs had VL bus for Graphics card to access 32bit.
The first generation has ISA Bus as the CPU bus, i386/i486 compatible PC Machine split
ISA Bus from CPU bus. CPU->Memory/VL(33MHz) ,CPU->ISA(8.25MHz)
DOS app can use VM86 with EMM386.EXE(DPMI) or DOS/4G
Some vendor created OS indepent standard of VCPI to switch 32bit/Protect mode.
However, DPMI DOS/4G were simple enough to use the huge memory for these applications at time.
VCPI did not exist.
1991?
386SX(486DX) + Main Memory 4MB + VLBUS(SVGA) + HDD(IDE:PIO Mode)80MB + ISA(SoundBlaster) + FDD(720KB/1.44MB) + PS/2 Mouse

After i486 generation, the PC did not have hardeare compatibilty with PCAT(i286)
The PC had only ISA bus compatibility.
After booted from BIOS, the PC had the INT of BIOS, some IO ports, compatible register. 
However ACPI standard obsolated these non-standard
But, in 16bit(Windows98/3.1), Windows can not allocate flat memory bigger than 64KB.
Graphics driver slide memory to switch segment regsiter, which make system slow.
After introduced Windows 3.0 enchance mode, except NT series, Windows 16bit applications 
required 16bit(Protect mode) developed in Windows 2. Windows had so many 16bit code(Thunking)
However, Windows 95 introduced Protect Mode 32bit(VxD)
In NT series, application could use 32bit flat address with Win32 API
However Windows NT had NTVDM to execute Win16 through Windows on Windows.

Linus comments
only the kernel page functions use the >1Mb addresses directly.
All "normal" functions use just the lower 1Mb, or the local data space,
which will be mapped to some other place - mm keeps track of that.

This original limited BIOS paramter in IBM PC(X) can support 720KB.
One sector is 512byte 80x2x9 = 1,440 x 512 = 737,280 -> 720KB(PCXT)
Non-IBM PC 80x2x18 = 2,880  x 512 = 1,474,560 (1.44MB)   
They can not support1.44MB. Non-IBM PC introducted 1.44KB support with Windows.
OS/2 were not supported well by Microsoft, after Microsoft introducted Widows 3.1
The history of consumer PC OS were DOS1.1 -> DOS3.3 -> Windows 3.x/DOS5(co-existent)->
Windows 95->Windows98/NT4(SP6)->Windows 2000->Windows XP.
This happened from 1981->2001(20 years)
1.44MB required sectors from 1 to 18.
Microsoft Macro Assembler was developed for MS-DOS
The success of IBM PC make this assembler defacto and then, introduced a lots of peudo instructions to 
support micro rather than C Language to implement this CPU complicated CPU mode handling. 
Indeed, if someone deeply knew Intel CPU, these micros were very useful to implement system rather than C Language.AT&T
Microsft assember is using the opposite description for source and destination.


X86 and x86-64 have different first bytes instruction scheme.
But some byte value shared the same semantics.
0x0f is for two bytes instruction
0x66, 0x067 are for operand-size and address-size override(prefix)
x86-32 can support SSE instruction series SSE,SSE2, SSE3,SSE4.1,SSE4.2,
because SSE instruction scheme is almost identical to MMX.
MMX was introduced into 32bit(x86)
SSE
Operand prefix, Two bytes marks, MMX opcode, operand1, operand2
0x66                   0x0F                       , 0x38,               , xmm0 ,xmm1
However, AVX was newly introduced into x86-64.
In x86-64, AMD assigned some reserved first byte value for the future extension.
Intel try to use the reserved byte.
VEX prefix : 0xc4 and 0xc5
EVEX prefix: 0x62
In x86-32bit mode, these bytes had the different semantics of instructions.
But , these new instructions only focus in 64bit mode.
