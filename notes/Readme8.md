Is that possible to create installation image to bootstrap linux and manual copying way like archlinux but
use deb packages. If we don't follow the debian/ubuntu package name schemes. most likely I cannot installation
Microsoft Edge because the package is compiled in standard Debian/Ubuntu environment so even slightly different 
user land causes issues to install it.

I found a light way, pure wayland, glib(gsetting) base Qt5/Ui based desktop.

If I can make those packages into deb in debian/ubuntu, then if I install Microsoft edge which requires gnome-keyring.. it will work? I mean gnome-keyring and MS Edge should work on XWayland.

Is that meaningful/possible to install those desktop environment without display manager(login screen manager)
